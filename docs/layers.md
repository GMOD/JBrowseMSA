# Data layers

The view snapshot is the API: every layer below is a snapshot field, so it
travels in a shared URL, a session, a React prop, or an R argument, and the SVG
export draws it. Wherever a row is named, positions are that row's residues,
1-based and inclusive, as in GFF; the viewer projects them through the
alignment's gaps.

## highlights

A labeled band over a column range or a residue range, or a tint over a set of
rows. `label` and `color` are optional; `color` is any CSS color and paints the
band, its border, or the row tint.

```json
"highlights": [
  { "row": "human", "start": 248, "end": 248, "label": "R248Q · 651/658 R" },
  { "start": 40, "end": 60, "label": "NES", "color": "rgba(0,120,255,0.25)" },
  { "rows": ["beluga", "dolphin"], "label": "frameshift carriers" }
]
```

`row` plus `start`/`end` is a residue range of that row. Without `row` the range
is alignment columns, also 1-based. `rows` marks whole rows across the tree
labels and the alignment, with the label in the tree gutter. A range that lands
entirely on hidden gappy columns draws nothing; one that straddles them shrinks
to what is visible. Row names that match no row are ignored.

React: the `highlights` prop on `MSAViewer`, or `model.setHighlights(list)`. R:
`msaview(highlights = list(list(row = "human", start = 248, end = 248)))`.
